## Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Provider | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Project URL | `https://fbenxxnclsxztfrfpmjs.supabase.co` |
| Connection | Pooler via `aws-0-eu-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543` |
| Database | `postgres` |

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `reports` | Core report data (category, location, verification, resolution, urgency, coordinates) |
| `report_images` | Multiple images per report, with primary flag |
| `report_notes` | Timeline of public/internal notes with author tracking |
| `status_history` | Audit trail — who changed what, when, old/new values |
| `officers` | Authority user accounts |
| `public_notices` | Public announcements displayed on home page |

### Status Model

Reports have two independent status dimensions:

| Dimension | Values | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Verification** | Pending → Approved / Rejected | Is the report legitimate? |
| **Resolution** | Ongoing → In Progress → Resolved | What's happening with the issue? (Approved reports only) |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React 18, React Router, Leaflet (maps), Vite |
| Backend | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, python-jose (JWT) |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL (via connection pooler) |
| Map | OpenStreetMap tiles via Leaflet |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:8000`. Database auto-seeds with 10 demo reports on first launch.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000` and proxies API requests to the backend.

## Pages & Features

### Public Pages

| Page | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Home | `/` | Interactive map with color/size-coded markers, filterable report list, public notices, Atlas Mountains background |
| Submit Report | `/submit` | Guest submission with map location picker (click to pin), multi-image upload (up to 5), category/location validation |
| Track Report | `/track` | Lookup by CIN + reference number, shows verification/resolution status and public notes |

### Key Features

- **Multi-image upload** — up to 5 photos per report with preview thumbnails
- **Two-status model** — verification (Pending/Approved/Rejected) + resolution (Ongoing/In Progress/Resolved)
- **Notes timeline** — officers add public/internal notes without overwriting history
- **Status audit trail** — every change logged with officer name, timestamp, old/new values

- **Interactive SVG backgrounds** — unique nature scenes per page (mountains, forest, lake, snow)

### Map Features

- **Color-coded markers** by category (Wildfire=red, Pollution=purple, Snow Closure=blue, etc.)

- **Legend** showing color and size mappings
- **Click markers** to see report summary popup
- **Bidirectional selection** — clicking a report highlights its marker and vice versa
